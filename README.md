# Welcome

Pluto is a mock operating system in the style of Macintosh System 6, but with the abilities of a modern web app.

It is inspired by the awesome [Poolside.fm](https://poolside.fm), but here you are invited to participate in building new features and programs.

The thing is built in React and instructions on how to set up the development environment are in CONTRIBUTING.md.
