# Welcome

Pluto is a vaporware computer operating system (and pluto computer club; some kind of collaborative open source art collective..?)

The idea and esthetics is very inspired by the awesome [Poolside.fm](https://poolside.fm), but here you are invited to participate in building new features and programs.

The thing is built in React and instructions on how to set up the development environment are in CONTRIBUTING.md.
