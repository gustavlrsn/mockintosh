# Welcome

Mockintosh is a mock operating system in classic Macintosh OS style.

The code is [open source](https://github.com/gustavlrsn/mockintosh) but all credit for the design language and most icons belong to [Susan Kare](https://twitter.com/SusanKare), the designer of the original Macintosh GUI.

It is built with React and instructions on how to set up the development environment are in CONTRIBUTING.md.

### Development

`esc-pos-encoder` needs some support canvas libraries to be able to be installed (ref: https://github.com/NielsLeenheer/EscPosEncoder/issues/73)

add those with

`brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg`
