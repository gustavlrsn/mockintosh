# Hi

Welcome to Pluto, a vaporware computer operating system (and somekind of collaborative open source art experiment..)

The idea and esthetics is very inspired by the awesome [Poolside.fm](https://poolside.fm), but here you are invited to participate in building new features and apps.

Join the development on [GitHub](https://github.com/plutocomputerclub/pluto). It is built in React so if you are familiar with that you will be able to be up and running very quickly.
