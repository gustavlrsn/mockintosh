 *                  take the key window. Hidden when another app is frontmost.
 * - `plain`      — a bare 1px frame, no title bar, cannot be moved
 *                  (`plainDBox`)
 * - `alert`      — square double frame (1px / 2px white / 2px), system-modal:
 *                  every other window ignores input until it closes (`dBoxProc`)
 * - `fullscreen` — no chrome at all; covers the whole screen, menubar
 *                  included. Touching the top edge slides the menubar down
