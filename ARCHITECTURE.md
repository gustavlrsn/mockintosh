# Mockintosh Architecture

Mockintosh is a mock operating system in the style of an early Macintosh, running in the browser. It renders at the original 512×342 resolution, scaled up to fit the browser window, into a 1-bit pixel buffer: every pixel is white or black, and every shade in between is a dither pattern, exactly as on the original hardware.

## High-Level Overview

The entire UI is rendered to a **single `<canvas>` element** backed by the 1-bit framebuffer: a QuickDraw `BitMap` packed exactly as on the original Macintosh — 8 pixels per byte, most-significant bit leftmost, `1` = black, rows padded to a 16-bit word (`packedBits.ts` in `@mockintosh/quickdraw` is the only code that knows this layout). A 512×342 screen is 22 KB, and the same bytes can be handed to a 1-bit panel driver or an ESC/POS printer unchanged. There is no HTML/CSS rendering within the simulated screen. Colour is deliberately out of scope; if it ever returns it will come in the way Color QuickDraw did — a `PixMap` with a `pixelSize` beside the 1-bit `BitMap` — rather than as a palette bolted onto the monochrome path.

The frontend is built with **Vite** and a **SolidJS custom renderer** (`@mockintosh/ui`) that paints a retained `box` / `text` / `image` / `raster` tree through QuickDraw into that framebuffer. The OS shell lives in `src/os` and is brought up by `bootOS(platform)` (`src/os/boot.ts`); the browser entry point `src/solidMain.ts` just builds the web platform and calls it. The backend runs as **Vercel Edge Functions** in the same repo.

## Layering

```
@mockintosh/quickdraw (GrafPort, CopyBits, fonts)
        ↓
@mockintosh/ui (Solid universal renderer, layout, draw, pointer + focus)
        ↓
src/os shell (bootOS, signals, window chrome, menubar, dialogs, app registry)
        ↓
apps/*.tsx bundled apps         @mockintosh/sdk v2 → third-party ESM

src/platform/<host>  ─ implements Platform ─▶  bootOS(platform)
```

`createUI` is a **single-instance** renderer (`_setRepaintHook`, QuickDraw font globals). The OS is the only caller.

## Kernel (Toolbox traps)

Each `BootedOS` owns a `Kernel`: a trap dispatcher with an instance identity, boot generation, and caller sessions. Sessions identify the caller and own cleanup; they are not an ACL. `defineOperation` keeps each trap's input schema, result schema, and handler together. The same table is what MCP lists, what Terminal runs, and what Source Editor calls.

Traps are grouped as managers in documentation only:

| Manager | Traps |
| --- | --- |
| File | `stat`, `list`, `read` / `read_bytes`, `write` / `write_bytes`, `mkdir`, `remove`, `move`, `copy` |
| Settings | `desktop_pattern` (Control Panel and Desktop use the same typed service; bytes live in Preferences) |
| Window / Event | `apps`, `open`, `windows`, `activate`, `inspect`, `click`, `dblclick`, `drag`, `type`, `key`, `pointer`, `menu`, `render`, `screenshot` / `screenshot_save` |
| Project | `project_create`, `source_open`, `build_submit`, `build_status`, `build_cancel`, `app_install`, `app_restart`, `app_restore`, `instances` |

Finder and `useApp().fs` keep talking **node ids and roles**. File traps resolve a path through `Disk`: `/disk` is a shell prefix for the volume root, not a mount. Catalog v3 revisions and compare-and-swap writes make two writers (human + agent) safe.

`@mockintosh/ui` exposes detached immutable inspection snapshots. Automation validates live targets and routes gestures through the same boot input handlers as human events. The S1 shell is an adapter over traps; `help` comes from the command table. The browser's opt-in companion, CLI, and MCP select an explicit boot and invoke traps. Disconnect never causes a headless fallback or automatic mutation replay.

Handlers receive an `Execution` with the caller, cancellation, streams, the boot `Disk`, and nested `invoke`. See [toolbox-cut.md](docs/toolbox-cut.md) and [M1 operation](docs/m1-operation.md).

## App projects, builds, and lifetimes

`Kernel` caller lifetimes own cleanup; revocation releases shell sessions and cancels pending work. One `ShellManager` serves Terminal and RPC. Outcome history is independent from live sessions, whose idle retention is bounded.

`src/os/projects` owns source snapshots, persisted immutable build records, selected/previous artifacts, and install/restart/recovery operations. The browser and companion implement the same `BuildProvider`: the browser defaults to a lazy module worker; the companion runs a cancellable worker process. Both typecheck and compile without executing project source. `src/shared/buildPolicy.ts` owns source limits, supported imports, and TypeScript options. The browser embeds the shipped SDK sources/declarations for typechecking; compiler code and assets stay out of the initial desktop load. Pairing can select the companion provider; disconnect restores the local provider for subsequent builds, without replaying in-flight work. `Platform.loadArtifact` loads persisted ESM in the host's shared runtime. Neither compilation nor Blob URLs belong in the kernel. Source Editor and shell commands use the same registered operations and revision checks.

`AppInstances` owns actual launch lifetimes and window ids. The window store still owns geometry, ordering, and rendering. App contexts register cleanup and explicitly retain background work; restart disposes the old instance and launches the selected build. Component initialization errors are caught at the window and attributed to the instance. This is the lifecycle needed for app replacement, not a general process table.

The shipped [M2 app-building slice](docs/m2-apps.md) creates, builds, runs, edits, restarts, restores, and reopens Counter after reboot. Shell S2 and a general multi-file editor remain planned.

## Platform layer

Everything above the dashed line compiles **without DOM types**; `npm run check:core` (`tsconfig.core.json`, `lib: es2022`, no `@types`) enforces it. The only host globals the core assumes are the ones every engine we target provides — `console`, timers, `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder` — listed exhaustively in `src/platform/core-env.d.ts`. Anything else the OS needs from the machine comes through one object:

```ts
interface Platform {
  display:   { width, height, framebuffer?, present(screen: BitMap) }
  input:     { onPointer(handler), onKey(handler) }      // raw events, screen coordinates
  scheduler: { requestFrame(cb), now() }                  // what varies about time
  storage:   FSBackend                                    // the disk
  env:       { origin }
  hostCapabilities: HostCapability[]                      // camera, video, images, browser
  clipboard?, printer?, fetch?                            // peripherals; absent = feature hidden
}
```

The design follows the Macintosh: required members are what every Mac had (screen, mouse, keyboard, clock, disk); optional members are peripherals, and the OS hides the corresponding features (Print buttons, copy/paste) when they are missing. Double-click detection, ⌘-shortcuts, and paste are OS policy and live in `bootOS`, so a platform only reports what the hardware saw.

Implementations:

- `src/platform/web/` — `<canvas>` + `CanvasPresenter`, DOM events, `requestAnimationFrame`, `OPFSBackend`, `navigator.clipboard`, `WebUSBPrinterTransport`, `fetch`. The only OS-level code allowed to touch the DOM.
- `src/platform/headless/` — in-memory display with frame read-back, synthetic input injection, a hand-advanced clock, `InMemoryBackend`. `src/os/boot.test.ts` boots the whole shell on it and drives menus, ⌘N, and the capability dialog from Node. It is the starting point for any new host: swap `present()` and the input injectors for real drivers.

Which apps ship is the entry point's decision, not the OS's: `src/systemApps.ts` registers the web build's bundled apps; a device build imports a different list. Bundled apps are written against `@mockintosh/sdk` only — `export default defineApp(…)`, `useApp()` — so they are the same shape as a third-party bundle and could be moved out of the tree. Five are OS-owned and reach into `src/os` on purpose: Finder (desktop and folder windows), Terminal (kernel shell sessions), Control Panel (persistent settings), and App Store (installation privileges). Source Editor owns project editing. Finder, Terminal, and Source Editor are registered by boot; other bundled apps are registered by the host.

### Capabilities

Apps declare what they cannot work without — `requires: ["camera"]` on `defineApp`/`registerApp`, and on App Store manifests. `platformCapabilities(platform)` (`src/os/capabilities.ts`) derives the set this machine has: `network`/`clipboard`/`printer` from the services present, the rest from `hostCapabilities`. The OS refuses to launch an app with unmet requirements and tells the user why (“*"Photo Booth" needs a camera, which this Macintosh does not have.*”), and skips loading installed bundles it cannot run (their shortcuts explain the same when opened). Apps that work with *or* without a feature check `useApp().capabilities` at the point of use instead — Picture opens sprite files everywhere and gates PNG decoding on `images`.

## App model

### System apps

Bundled Solid components registered with `registerApp` (`src/os/apps.ts`):

```ts
interface SolidApp<P = Record<string, never>> {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  icon: string;
  defaultSize: { width: number; height: number };   // the main window's
  windowKind?: WindowKind;                           // the main window's (default "document")
  scrollable?: boolean;
  resizable?: boolean;
  minSize?: { width: number; height: number };
  singleInstance?: boolean;
  menus?: MenubarDefinition[];   // the app's menubar
  Component: (props: P) => JSX.Element;              // the main window's content
  onOpen?(app: AppContext, props: P): void;          // the app's `main`; default: open the main window
}
```

### Opening an app

`openApp(appId, props, fromRect)` (`boot.ts`) is what the Finder calls for an icon or a document. It checks `requires`, brings an already-open matching window to the front (same `fileId` / `directoryId`, or any window when `singleInstance`), and otherwise runs the app's **`onOpen`** with an `AppContext` — the Macintosh `main` receiving its `'oapp'`/`'odoc'` event. The default `onOpen` opens the main window; an app that supplies its own decides for itself: open in full screen, show a dialog first, open nothing. Whether an app opens a window is the app's business, not the OS's.

Windows are opened through **`AppContext.openWindow(spec)`** (`OSServices.openWindow` underneath, `buildAppWindow` in `appWindow.ts` — this shell's `NewWindow`). A `WindowSpec` names the kind, title, size, position, `scrollable`/`resizable`, and optionally a `Component` other than the app's main one; every field defaults to the `defineApp` declaration, so `openWindow()` is the main window. The first window opened from an icon gets the zoom-rect animation. `OSWindow.Component` holds a window's own component when it has one; `WindowContent` mounts it, else the app's.

`AppContext` (`appContext.ts`) is everything an app can do without a window — sprites, storage, `fs`, `os.openApp/closeWindow/showDialog`, `openWindow`, `fetch`, `print`, `capabilities`, `env`. `AppServices`, what `useApp()` returns inside a window, is `AppContext` plus `window` and `setMenus`. The OS supplies one `AppServices` per window. `useWindow()` (shell-internal) exposes `{ id, width, height, isActive, scrollY, kind, setTitle, setContentSize, setInfoBar, setMenus, setContentTopInset, setFullScreen, close }`.

Finder is registered like any other app (`FINDER_APP_ID`): the desktop is its window-less surface and folder windows are its windows (`kind: "finder-folder"`, `props: { directoryId }`). Apps that need to write pixels directly (video frames, dithered photos) use a `<raster onPaint>` node, which hands them a `RasterSurface` (`setPixel` / `blitPixels` / `fill` in raster-local coordinates, plus the clipped QuickDraw port); the framebuffer's memory layout never reaches app code. There is no other rendering path.

### Apps, windows, and the menubar

Windows belong to apps via `OSWindow.appId`; the **active app** is derived, never stored: the active window's app, or the Finder when nothing is open (`getActiveAppId()` in `state.ts`). System-modal alerts borrow the menubar of the frontmost non-modal window.

Menus are owned by apps, not windows. `SolidApp.menus` (or `setAppMenus(appId, …)` for menus that change at runtime) registers an app's menubar; `useWindow().setMenus` sets a *per-window override* for menus that depend on window state (Finder's "Clean Up" is enabled only inside a folder). `getMenubarMenus()` resolves override → app menus → `[]`, so switching windows always shows the right menus with no imperative sync.

### Third-party apps (SDK v2)

```ts
export default defineApp({
  id: "myapp",
  title: "My App",
  icon: "myapp/icon",
  defaultSize: { width: 200, height: 120 },
  Component() { return <box padding={8}><text font="body">Hi</text></box>; },
});
```

Bundles externalize `solid-js`, `solid-js/store`, `@mockintosh/ui`, and `@mockintosh/sdk`. The OS serves those via an import map so one Solid runtime is shared. The `AppInstaller` (`src/os/installedApps.ts`) fetches the bundle through `Platform.loadModule`, validates `Component`, registers the module's `sprites`, and calls `registerApp`; a platform without `loadModule` (an embedded build) has no installer and the App Store says so. The App Store filters catalog entries to `sdk` major ≥ 2.

`useApp()` provides `getSprite`, `storage` (per-app folder), `fs` (the shared file system), `window` (this window's reactive size, `isActive`, `scrollY`, `kind`, `setTitle`, `setFullScreen`, `close`), `openWindow` (another window of this app), `os.openApp/closeWindow/showDialog`, `setMenus` (this window's menubar), `capabilities`, optional `fetch` and `print`, and `env`. Sprite files (`image/x-mockintosh-sprite`) are read and written with `readSpriteFile` / `writeSpriteFile` from the SDK. Apps that declare `fileTypes` are launched with `FileDocumentProps` when such a file is opened. The OS supplies one `AppServices` per window through the SDK's `AppServicesContext`, so each window's components see their own.

The SDK is the single source of the app contract shared with the OS: `SolidApp` (the internal `src/os/apps.ts` type extends it) and the menubar types (`MenubarDefinition`, `MenubarItemDef`, …) live in `packages/sdk/src` and the shell imports them from `@mockintosh/sdk`.

## Rendering pipeline

Each dirty frame:

1. Solid tree → layout → QuickDraw paint (`ui.frame()`). The tree ends with `ScreenCorners`, an inert layer that anchors the rounded-CRT corner sprites with `right`/`bottom` absolute layout above every window and menu.
2. `drawCursor` composites QuickDraw's `cursorState.cursor` (mask `srcBic`, data `srcOr`) at the pointer — the only thing drawn outside the tree, standing in for the Mac's VBL cursor task
3. `platform.display.present(screen)` — on the web, `CanvasPresenter` expands the packed bits to RGBA on the 2D canvas

`InitGraf` allocates the framebuffer (`globals.screenBits`) unless the display owns one (`display.framebuffer`, for DMA-backed panels); the shell hands the same `BitMap` to `createUI` and to the display, so nothing else owns pixel memory.

QuickDraw paints through the original `RgnBlt` / `StretchBits` pipeline (`CopyBits`, `ScrollRect`, and every shape verb). Word-wide `BitBlt` fast paths are omitted unless they are pixel-identical to the general path. `BitBltSlow` is the per-pixel oracle tests compare against; it is not part of the public surface.

Sprites (`Sprite` in `@mockintosh/ui`, re-exported by the SDK) stay 1 byte per pixel as an asset format, with `defineSprite` (2 bpp base64) and `fromGrid` (ASCII art) as the two decoders; `<image>` packs each sprite to a `BitMap` once (cached per sprite) and draws it with `CopyBits`.

Layout snaps every node to the pixel grid (positions floor, sizes round) so centering and percentages never produce half-pixels, which QuickDraw would refuse to draw.

## QuickDraw

`@mockintosh/quickdraw` is a TypeScript rewrite of Bill Atkinson's 1984 QuickDraw (`reference/QuickDraw`). The public entry is exactly `QuickDraw.p` + `GrafUtil.p` plus the three OS seams the original left outside the unit. Pixel helpers (`newBitMap`, `getBit`, `makeRect`, …) live on `@mockintosh/quickdraw/bits`.

### Adaptation policy

A faithful port in another language is not a byte-for-byte emulation. These eight deviations are accepted; everything else should match the original exactly (`docs/quickdraw-fidelity-plan.md` §4):

1. **Memory / handles.** Handles are object references; `NewHandle` / `SetSize` / `DisposHandle` become allocation and GC. Growth-in-chunks (`polyMax`, `rgnMax`, `picMax`) and the 16-bit size cap of `QuickGlue.a` are dropped. `Kill*` / `Dispose*` may be no-ops.
2. **Word size.** 16-bit wraparound of coordinates is not emulated, except where the original relies on 16.16 fixed-point (`FixRatio`, `FixMul`, `|0` wraps in `DrawArc` / `DrawLine` / `PutLine`) — those go through `fixmath.ts` and `|0`.
3. **Traps → functions.** `_LongMul` / `_FixMul` / `_FixRatio` are local functions with ROM semantics. VAR parameters mutate the passed object; `GetPort` may return a value.
4. **Bounds-check.** Where the original would read or write arbitrary memory, the port bounds-checks and returns white / zero. Where the original would trap (nil `thePort`), the port throws `QDError` (`'QuickDraw: thePort is NIL'`). Query routines that do not dereference `thePort` keep working without one.
5. **Three OS seams.** The screen (`InitGraf(screenBits: BitMap)`), the Font Manager (`installFontManager` + `FMInput` / `FMOutput` / `FontStrike`), and the cursor engine (`$800` vectors + `cursorState`) stay outside QuickDraw, with the original record shapes — not convenience callbacks.
6. **Pixel-identical shortcuts only.** 68k word-wide `BitBlt` cases, `StretchBits` ratio tables, and `_StackAvail` text splits are omitted. JS may skip work when pixels match: `TrimRect` + all-rect `BitBlt`, `DrText` direct-to-screen, `DrawArc` solid-rect slabs, span apply under a region mask, pooled blit scratch, and skipping `ShieldCursor` when the vector is the default no-op. See `packages/quickdraw/README.md`.
7. **Packed regions + PICT serialize.** Regions use the packed XOR-delta inversion-point stream (`Int16Array`, not raw bytes). `Picture` is `{picSize, picFrame, data}` with `serializePicture` / `parsePicture` producing exact PICT v1 bytes.
8. **Pixel helpers on `./bits`.** `packedBits.ts` (`getBit` / `setBit` / `newBitMap` / `rowBytesFor` / `bitMapFromPixels` / `pixelsFromBitMap`) and `makePoint` / `makeRect` / `cloneRect` are host utilities, not QuickDraw. Import them from `@mockintosh/quickdraw/bits`.

Anything in the fidelity catalogue marked ADDED, SIMPLIFIED, BUG, or MISSING that is not on this list is in scope for removal or restoration.

### How to verify against `reference/QuickDraw`

- Source files carry `file:line` comments pointing at the original (`reference/QuickDraw/*.a`, `QuickDraw.p`, `GrafUtil.p`) so a reader can diff a TypeScript routine against the assembly.
- Internal helpers keep the original names (`DoLine`, `FrRect`, `PushVerb`, `RgnBlt`, `SeekRgn`, `CheckPic`) and file grouping; they are not re-exported from the barrel. Tests that need them import the source path (`../src/bitblt`, `../src/rgnBlt`, …).
- No `Math.max(1, …)`, no `portRect` in a blitter, no `as any`, no `scanlines` region encoding. `packages/quickdraw/tests/fidelity.test.ts` greps `src/*.ts` for those.
- Run the suite: `npx vitest run packages/quickdraw/tests`.
- Departures from the assembly that are not listed above are bugs.

Pointer events hit-test the node tree (`ui.dispatchPointer`) with capture: the node that received `mouseDown` keeps `drag` / `mouseUp`. There is no bubbling — a press goes to the topmost node with a handler — but there *is* a capture phase: `onMouseDownCapture` runs on every ancestor of the hit (root-most first) before the target's `onMouseDown`, and `preventDefault()` swallows the press along with its mouseup / click / drag. A press also makes the nearest `focusScope` the active one. Keyboard goes to the focus manager; ⌘ shortcuts are handled by the shell first.

The node tree follows DOM semantics: `insertChild` *moves* an already-attached node, which is what Solid's `<For>` relies on when `WindowStack` reorders windows.

Window drag/resize uses an XOR outline (`penMode="xor"` / `darkCheckers`) driven by `state.ts`.

### Window chrome invariant

Nothing inside a window can alter its chrome. The body box draws the 1px frame as its border and clips children (`overflow="hidden"`); `@mockintosh/ui` follows the CSS box model, so children are laid out *inside* the border and clipped to it. Header content that belongs to the window (e.g. Finder's item count) goes through `win.infoBar`, not the content area. All chrome metrics live in `src/os/windowGeometry.ts`; apps needing screen-space geometry use `windowContentRect()` rather than hardcoding title-bar heights.

### Window activation invariant

Activation is owned by the shell, not by content. The window body's `onMouseDownCapture` (`handleActivationPress` in `Window.solid.tsx`) is the only place `bringToFront` is called from a pointer event. A press on an inactive window brings it to the front; if the press is on the title bar it continues as a drag, anywhere else it is swallowed so content never reacts to the click that focused its window (classic Mac). While an `alert` is open, presses on every other window are swallowed (`isBlockedByModal`). Apps therefore never need to — and must not — call `bringToFront` themselves.

## Window kinds and layering

A window's `kind` selects a **window definition** (`src/os/windowKinds.ts`) — the table the Macintosh kept in the WDEF a `procID` pointed at. It is the only place a kind's chrome, layer and modality are spelled out; `Window.solid.tsx`, `windowGeometry.ts` and `layering.ts` read it and never test the kind themselves.

| Kind              | Mac `procID`      | Chrome                                              | Layer                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `"document"`      | `zoomDocProc`     | title, close, zoom; grow box / scroll bars if asked | 1 documents                  |
| `"finder-folder"` | —                 | a document the Finder can tell apart                | 1                            |
| `"dialog"`        | `movableDBoxProc` | title, close; no zoom, no grow                      | 1                            |

| `"fullscreen"`    | —                 | none; bounds are the screen, menubar hidden         | 3 above utilities            |

`buildAppWindow` clamps size/position to the desktop (gray region minus 3 px). Zoom box toggles `standardBounds` vs `userBounds`. Opening from a Finder icon plays the zoom-rect animation.

**Full screen** is the Macintosh "special presentation mode": the application takes the whole screen, menubar included, and is responsible for offering a way back (HIG). `setWindowFullScreen(id, on)` (`useApp().window.setFullScreen`) switches a window into and out of `fullscreen` *in place* — the content stays mounted, as with the zoom box — remembering its windowed kind and bounds in `OSWindow.windowed`. A window may also be *opened* as `fullscreen`; it has no windowed form to return to. While the frontmost non-modal window covers the screen, `isMenubarHidden()` is true and `OSRoot` does not paint the menubar, but `getMenubarMenus()` is unchanged, so the app's ⌘ shortcuts keep working: that, plus an on-screen "Menu Bar" button, is how Photo Booth gets out.

## Event flow

```
platform.input (raw down/up/move/scroll, key down/up)
   → bootOS: double-click detection, ⌘V paste via platform.clipboard,
             ⌘ shortcut scan of the active menubar
   → ui.dispatchPointer / dispatchKeyboard
```

## File System

`@mockintosh/fs` (`packages/fs`) is the virtual file system: a **reactive catalog** (Solid store of `FSNode`s keyed by id, plus a per-directory child index and a per-volume role index) over a pluggable **`FSBackend`** that stores the catalog as one JSON document and file bodies as blobs (`OPFSBackend` in the browser, `InMemoryBackend` in tests). Reads (`children`, `node`, `locate`, `attributes`, …) are store reads, so a Finder memo that lists one folder re-runs only when that folder changes — there is no change-notification plumbing. Mutations (`mkdir`, `writeFile`, `rename`, `move`, `remove`, `setAttributes`) are the only writers; `batch()` coalesces several into one reactive update and one persistence write.

```
FileSystem (packages/fs)       catalog + bodies, roles, attributes, migrations
  └ FSBackend                  OPFSBackend | InMemoryBackend
src/os/fsBootstrap.ts          first-boot layout; repairs role folders each boot
src/os/openers.ts              MIME type → app (`SolidApp.fileTypes`)
packages/sdk/src/spriteFile.ts readSpriteFile / writeSpriteFile (image/x-mockintosh-sprite)
src/os/appStorage.ts           useApp().storage → System Folder/Preferences/<appId>/
src/os/installedApps.ts        App Store manifests as MIME.app files in Applications
apps/finder/attributes.ts      Finder's typed view of node attributes
```

**Layout.** Root → volumes → folders. Well-known folders carry a `role` (`volume`, `desktop`, `trash`, `applications`, `system`, `preferences`) and are found with `fs.locate(role)`, never by name — the user may rename them. At most one folder per role per volume.

**Types.** A file has one MIME `type` (`MIME` constants: `text/plain`, `image/x-mockintosh-sprite`, `application/x-mockintosh-app-shortcut`, `application/x-mockintosh-app`, `application/x-decker`, …) and a byte `size`. Bodies are bytes; `readText`/`readJSON`/`writeJSON` are conveniences.

**Attributes.** Consumers (not the FS) own per-node metadata bags: the Finder's icon, free-form position and stacking order live there, typed only in `apps/finder/attributes.ts`; the installer keeps `appId` on manifest files. The FS persists them and removes them with the node.

**Durability.** A body is written to the backend *before* its catalog entry appears; an entry is removed *before* its body is deleted. The catalog is debounced (500 ms) and versioned: `parseCatalog` migrates older documents (the v1 `FileManager` catalog → v2: MIME types, roles, attributes → v3: persisted revisions) and drops unreachable nodes rather than failing.

**Opening.** A double-click asks `resolveOpenAction`: directories open a Finder window; `MIME.appShortcut` / `MIME.app` launch the referenced app; other files launch the first registered app whose `fileTypes` includes the MIME type, with `FileDocumentProps` (`fileId`, `title`) as props. FileViewer opens `text/*`, Picture sprites and PNG/JPEG/GIF. Unknown types show a dialog, as does a shortcut or manifest whose app is no longer registered (`reason: "unknown-app"`).

**Apps.** `useApp().fs` exposes the same `FileSystem` (typed `AppFileSystem` in the SDK); `useApp().storage` is a per-app folder under `System Folder/Preferences`. Installed third-party manifests are `MIME.app` files in `Applications` and are loaded at boot by the `AppInstaller`.

## Printing

```
PrintPage (off-screen GrafPort, paper width)  →  EscPosEncoder  →  PrinterTransport
      @mockintosh/print                            @mockintosh/print       WebUSBPrinterTransport | (UART, socket…)
```

Printing follows the Macintosh Printing Manager model: the page is an ordinary QuickDraw port (`createPrintPage`), so anything that draws to the screen can draw to paper — `CopyBits` for pictures, `drawString` from `@mockintosh/ui` for text in the UI fonts. `EscPosEncoder` packs the finished 1-bit page into banded `GS v 0` raster commands plus feed and cut; it is pure and unit-tested. The `PrinterTransport` is the platform edge: `WebUSBPrinterTransport` (browser, Chromium) finds the device's bulk OUT endpoint and streams the bytes; a microcontroller would send the same bytes over UART.

The shell owns one system printer (`src/os/printing.ts`, like the Chooser) and hands it to apps as `useApp().print`, an *optional* capability: it is `undefined` when the platform has no transport, so apps hide their Print UI with `<Show when={print}>`. `printPicture` is the polaroid layout (picture enlarged and centred, caption beneath); `printPage` gives an app the raw port.

## App Store

Browses `registry.json`. Only `sdk` major ≥ 2 entries are shown. Install imports the ESM bundle, registers the Solid app, and persists the manifest.
